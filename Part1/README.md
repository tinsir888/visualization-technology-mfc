### Part 1. Program a single-document application that meets the following requirements

- MFC standard items, simple menus and docking toolbars;

- Implement a floating menu, including 2 menu items (rectangle and polygon), and corresponding shortcut keys (Ctrl+R, Ctrl+P);

- Click one of the menu items, and only the corresponding graphics will be displayed after the view area is refreshed (the rectangle is a square, and the polygon is a hexagon);

- Press the keyboard "V" key (case-insensitive) to start the cycle operation, so that a bitmap (size 8*8, designed by yourself) moves along the border of the corresponding graphic.
